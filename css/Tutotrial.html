                    The Coconut are grown in more than 80 countries of the world,
                with a production of 61 million tones per year. Itis exported by
                the tones around the world, bringing in revenue to various
                countries. However, they also have important use. The India
                produces near to 25% of the world’s coconut meat and fiber,
                which is made into oil, shampoo, rope, and door mats. Kerala
                produces half of India’s harvest. The majority of coconuts are
                cut by climbing the tree and cutting the nuts by hand. This
                process seem simple; however, itis actually dangerous. In
                response, there is a genuine need to develop a device .The study
                is to design a coconut tree climbing robot and cutting coconuts
                for farmers. It is very difficult to climb on coconut tree manually
                due to non constant cylindrical structure. The Professional
                climber could able to climb a coconut tree. There are no 100%
                safe coconuts cutting device currently in the market. This device
                will be easily use for the people who are having large coconut
                cultivation. The climbers, our group will device a coconut tree
                climbing and cutting robot that meets the following goals: It has
                controlled from the ground. All can able to operate the robot.
                The cutting method becomes as fast. It can successfully climb a
                coconut tree of variable diameters and height is made.
